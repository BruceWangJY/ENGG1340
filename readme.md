## Table Management System
### Problem Statements
This program targets to build a table management system for small resturaunts to manage the few tables of  different sizes.
### Problem Settings
This program focuses on a deli with a maximum capacity of 50 person. There will be 3 types of table: Table A for 2-3 person, Table B for 4-6 person and Table C for 7-8 person. The system will have the following functions:
 1) check whether a table is available or not; 
 2) occupy a table; 
 3) release a table; 
 4) given the number of a group of customers, suggest a vacant table with minimal enough seats;
 5) notify the waiter for tables occupied for too long(90 minutes for Table A and B, 2 hours for Table C).
 6) This system supports online reservation, customers can reserve a table that is available in advance. Each table can only  be reserved for 90 minutes. In this period, other customer cannot occupy this table. However, if customers donâ€™t show up in 90 minutes, this table will turn available for other customers to occupy and reserve.
