## Table Management System
### Problem Statements
This C++ program is aiming at helping a family-owned restaurant to have a table management system to control the status of each table to make up for the waiter shortage.

In reality, family-owned restaurant will have a relatively less table, but due to the waiter shortage, it is not easy for each waiter to remember which table is reserved by different customers. As a consequence, this program could help manage the table and help recommender the most suitable table when customers come. Moreover, considering the situation that customers might occupy a table for a long time to chat so that it might affect other waiting customers, this system could remind the waiter if a table is occupied by a certain group for a long time slot.

### Problem Settings
This program focuses on a deli with a maximum capacity of 50 person. There will be 3 types of table: Table A for 1-2 person, Table B for 3-4 person and Table C for 5-6 person. The total number of table should be less than 10. There will be 3 kinds of possible status of each table: avaliable, occupied or reserved. The system will have the following functions:(to be continued)
 1) To read from file including information such as table type and their number using file I/O, we have provided the data in the file; 
 2) To occupy and release a table, we use a function that gets the table size and number from the input and change the relevant status of table and simultaneously, use the clock() function to record the current time; 
 3) To change the number of tables or type of tables using changeSetting function, user need to input a number and its related size, then the imformation will be changed;
 4) To check whether a table is available or not using checkTable function, you need to input the table size and number, the the program will print the table status; 
 5) To print the current status of all table using printAll function;
 6) Given the number of a group of customers, suggest a vacant table with minimal enough seats using recommendTable function, it will print the minimum number of the suitable size;
 7) To notify the waiter for tables occupied for too long(90 minutes for Table A and B, 2 hours for Table C).
 8) This system supports reservation. Customers can reserve a table that is available in advance. Each table can only be reserved for 90 minutes. In this period, other customer cannot occupy this table. However, if customers donâ€™t show up in 90 minutes, this table will return available for other customers to occupy and reserve.
